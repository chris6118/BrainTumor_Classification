## ABSTRACT

This project delves into the classification of brain tumor Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive and malignant form of brain cancer, using an advanced deep learning approach. By analyzing medical imagery, such as MRI scans, this research aims to aid in the early detection and accurate classification of GBM, a critical step in improving treatment outcomes and patient care. Leveraging cutting-edge neural network architectures, this work bridges the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence, and medicine, specifically neurology and oncology. It also highlights the potential of AI to transform medical diagnostics by enhancing precision, reducing human error, and enabling faster decision-making in critical healthcare scenarios.
